VMVC Minimalistic, Simplistic MVC Framework
============================================================
Started out as a simple routing class now transformed in a mvc structured set of code for study purposes.
Trying to learn new things by creating a simple mvc framework since most opensource frameworks seem too heavy.

Work in progress!

Features
============================================================
The framework will feature a small and brief set of classes.
Just the basics!

- Authentication class
- Database class
- Ability to add vendors
- MVC routing
- Predefined routes
- Easy to extend
